As a little celebration for completion of my blog, I'm writing what I've experienced with the Open Source Contributon.

> **Note:** The Open Source Contributon is South Korean government-sponsored programme to encourage developers in open source contribution.

I joined RustPython team lead by [@youknowone](https://github.com/youknowone), and started to look around RustPython. For those who never heard about this awesome project, it's a Python interpreter written in Rust.

# Getting started

Since RustPython uses Gitter as its primary communication channel, we choosed Gitter too. The first thing I gotta do was run Python testsuite by running `cargo run --release -- -m test`. So I just run the command and--

It didn't go as I expected. Turns out many of the features were left unimplemented on Windows, so the tests are not really ready for Windows. However that wasn't bad news at all; I could work on these issue! After all that was the purpose of this programme.

# sys.getwindowsversion

[getwindowsversion](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sys.html#sys.getwindowsversion) is a function specific to Windows, which returns the version information of currently running Windows. It was somewhat easy since all I gotta do was invoke [GetVersionExW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getversionexw), and pass the result to the Python code.

Opening an issue is pretty easy. Write down a log of errors, and possible causes, and some references, and now you just opened a issue with all the useful information for maintainers.
